Purpose:

This repo contains my collections of the coding exercises that you may encounter during a coding interviews.

Initially most of the materials of this repo's questions and solutions come from a website called http://www.geeks4geeks.org. 
I supplied the detailed C++ implementation. I found that the collection in this website is more complete and useful than the 
coding exercises provided by the popular book of "Cracking the coding interview" by Gayle L. McDowell.

Coding screening interview by phone usually limited to algorithms involing an array of integer numbers. More complexed 
algorithms are left to an onsite interview session done on a white board or over a shared screen. 

I find myself doing these exercise is a good way to get myself concentrated and be in a conquering mode when facing a coding interviewer. 
It is way better than reading a lot of books and memorizing a lot of things but easily collapsed when facing a hard or tricky question.

Doing those exercises on regular basis is also a good way to keep the mind of an old programmer to be refresh and a good exercise to keep a
an energetic body and mind.

Array of integer exercises will have one of following problems listed and you are asked to describe an algorithm for it 
over the phone or write it on an one page screen shared with the interviewer.

Strings:

  String exercises are involving with the character manipulation of a single word, the character manipulation of a few words in a sentence,
  or the substring manipulation or search with certain criteria. 

  String problems are another categories of problems that is easier to describe over the phone or over a shared screen and can be coded in 
  a single screen of code or so.

Linked list:

    Linked list problems mostly used during an onsite interview or interview on a shared screen. This type of questions take time to complete the
    code and it needs one or more screens to hold the whole answer. But the varieties of the problems are much less than the array of integers.

Problems:

1. Finding middle element in a linked list

15. Implement stack using linked list
16. Given a linked list of 0's, 1's and 2's, sort it.
17. Delete without head pointer
